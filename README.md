# New tensorboard branch
2022-04-12 Implemented a functionality to follow the training progress in tensorboard by changing the file DQNSwapModelTraining.py
Code is adapted from code pulled from TIFX04-Kompilering-av-kvantdatorkod-State_to_value_CNN on the 12th of april.

I also added a logdir folder where the tensorboard event files and a .txt describing the training is saved. Thefore I also updated the DQNModel(StateToValue).zip with the newly trained model as an example.
